        assigned individually to each instance of a given class (in this case, a hashCode is going to be set for every
        'Customer' object that's going to be created during the execution). This hashCode is the responsible to speed
        the insertion, searching and sorting of the objects within ordered data-structures, because we can use this
        hash to identify univocally each of those objects, instead of considering the memory address as the first option.

        CONCLUSION: It's not necessary at all, to create the domain class that we need to operate inside the project,
        because we can perfectly bring the information the database directly onto the app.
        However, it's understood as good practice to represent all the existing SQL tables within the project, just
        as a way to check that everything stored in the database is usable information from the Java application.

        Each SQL table should be represented as a different class in Java, being each column a specific attribute.
        This is what the ORMs/ODMs do to map the SQL tables to entities of the programming language.
