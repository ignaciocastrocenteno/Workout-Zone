                        unchanged, the server's default name will be shown in this field.
                - Host: The name of the computer we're connecting to, which can be a personal computer or a server.
                        The host can be referenced with a name or with an IP address (e.g. the IP address for the
                        localhost is 127.0.0.1 and would be the same to say 'localhost' than this IP address).
                - Port: The specific port where the server is exposing the database/s to work on. It functions as
                        external gateway to connect to the server and then accessing the visible databases.
                - Login user: The user that's currently logged in working on the schemas. The privileges for each
                              user are going to be different, so they could access different levels of depth or
                              content that are available inside the database but aren't visible for all users.
